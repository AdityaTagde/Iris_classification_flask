# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸
This is a web-based application built with Flask that demonstrates machine learning to predict the species of the Iris flower based on its physical attributes. The application uses the famous Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):

- Length of the sepals
- Width of the sepals
- Length of the petals
- Width of the petals
## Working of the Iris_decision_tree_classifier

- The program takes data from the load_iris() function available in sklearn module.
- The program then creates a decision tree based on the dataset for classification.
- The user is then asked to enter the four parameters of his sample and prediction about the species of the flower is printed to the user.
## Libraries
To run this application locally, you'll need:

- Python 
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (optional for machine learning)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (optional for data visualization)
